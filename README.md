# Cpp-Project-Map
A C++ PROJECT that takes Location and Destination Input from user and computes the shortest path with directions.
The program uses the Graph-Data-Structures, and shortest path algorithm which calculates the shortest 
path from one point to other with ETA. However, I have desgined it for my University, it can be used
bigger areas as well
